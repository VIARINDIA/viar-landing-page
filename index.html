  <h2>How We Help Companies</h2>
  <p>
    At VIAR, we don’t just help you sell — we become your sales engine.
    Here’s how our unique step-by-step process turns your business into a revenue-generating powerhouse.
  </p>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Understanding Your Business</h3>
      <p>We start by truly listening — diving deep into your business, your products or services, and the customers you’re trying to reach. We uncover what makes you unique and how you’re positioned in the market, so every sales move we make is perfectly aligned to help you grow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Selective Partnerships</h3>
      <p>At VIAR, we look for businesses whose products are ready to win. It’s not a test — it’s about making sure that, when we step in to sell. If we say yes, it means we believe in your brand’s potential and we’re ready to help you prove it to the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>In-Depth Product Knowledge & Sales Planning</h3>
      <p>Before we ever sell a single product, we dive deep into products or services inside out — features, benefits, customer pain points, and the best ways to position them in the market. Together, we build a clear sales plan so that when VIAR goes to work, we’re selling with true expertise and a strategy designed for results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Launching Your Sales Channel</h3>
      <p>Once we’re on board, you gain an entirely new sales channel dedicated to your success. VIAR starts working behind the scenes — actively selling your products or services and bringing in real revenue with your help for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Direct Sales Execution</h3>
      <p>VIAR doesn’t just build strategies — we step into action. We directly sell your products or services through the channels where your customers are most engaged. Whether it’s digital platforms, social selling, events, or direct outreach, we handle the conversations and the selling for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Transparent Reporting</h3>
      <p>You deserve to know exactly what’s happening. VIAR provides clear, data-driven reports that show where every sale comes from, what’s working, and what can improve. We share insights and learnings along the way — so you’re always in control and never in the dark.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-card">
      <h3>Scaling for Growth</h3>
      <p>Once we’ve proven what works, VIAR focuses on scale. We expand your reach, refine our processes, and maximize results — turning a successful sales channel into your long-term growth engine. Because true success isn’t just selling today, but building momentum for tomorrow.</p>
